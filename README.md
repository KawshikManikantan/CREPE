# CREPE - Character Level Models for Text Classification  

Our goal is to use ConNets on character level embeddings and use it for text classification as proposed by the paper.  
We also proposed a model based on CANINE transformer technology which also classifies text on the character level and gives better results than that of the model proposed in the paper.  
We use the paper model as a baseline along with two other baselines: LSTM and Bag of Words based classifiers.  

# Baseline Models  
- Bag of Words Model
